/** Spatial-temporal encoder with topological role and trade-off conditioning. Features, all in [−1, 1]:
  *   - 0: latest trend of the node's output (−1, 0, +1)
  *   - 1: previous trend of the node's output (−1, 0, +1)
  *   - 2: magnitude of the last change of the node's output, tanh(|g_i(t) − g_i(t−1)| / scale)
  *   - 3: largest change of a neighbour's output, tanh(max_j |g_j(t) − g_j(t−1)| / scale)
  *   - 4: fraction of neighbours whose output changed in the last round
  *   - 5: local Bellman-Ford residual (see [[NeighbourhoodSignals.bellmanFordResidual]])
  *   - 6: fraction of neighbours routed through the node in the shortest-path tree (backbone vs. leaf)
  *   - 7: shortest wake-up period among the neighbours, divided by the longest admissible period
  *   - 8: the trade-off weight β (see [[TradeOff.betaFeature]])
